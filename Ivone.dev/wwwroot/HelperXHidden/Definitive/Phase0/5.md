# Phase 0.5 — What Not To Worry About Yet

## What To Learn
Some areas are legacy or specialized and are not required to understand the core system. Focus first on core data flow and reporting; return to legacy and special-case areas later.

## Why It Exists
Attempting to learn everything at once will obscure the core architecture and domain logic.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Legacy routes: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/AreasLegacy/*`
- Specialized worker services: `sonar-api/sonar-queue-*`, `sonar-api/sonar-wonde-runner`

## Safe Deferrals
- Legacy routes and endpoints unless you are assigned to a legacy feature.
- Multi-school aggregation logic unless working on multi-school reporting.
- Data warehouse ETL unless working on analytics exports.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which legacy areas can be postponed without breaking user stories?**
  - Any area under `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/AreasLegacy` that is not called by current frontends. Confirm by searching for endpoint usage in `sonar/sonar-web` and `sonar/reports-web`.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- What is the risk of modifying legacy routes without full context?
  - Legacy routes may depend on stored procedures or undocumented behaviors; changes can break existing workflows silently.

## Completion Check
You can list the parts of the system that are safe to defer and identify the core areas that must be learned first.
