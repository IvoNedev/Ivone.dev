# Phase 0.3 — What Problems Sonar Solves In Real Schools

## What To Learn
Sonar exists to solve assessment, reporting, and accountability problems in UK schools. It provides structured data capture and decision-ready outputs.

## Why It Exists
Schools need to demonstrate pupil progress, evaluate teaching outcomes, and meet statutory requirements. These needs are operational (day-to-day teaching) and governance-level (compliance and accountability).

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Assessment endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Assessment/*`
- Observation endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Observation/*`
- Reporting endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Reports/*`
- Statutory calculations: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Statutory/*`
- Reports UI: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/report/*`

## Core Problems And How Sonar Addresses Them
1. **Assessment Collection And Consistency**
   - Teachers enter summative judgments and formative evidence.
   - The system normalizes data via shared code sets and assessment points.

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Progress is calculated by comparing assessments across terms and academic years.
   - Orchestrators compute derived outputs for reports.

3. **Reporting For Different Audiences**
   - Class and pupil reports for teachers.
   - Cohort and summary reports for leadership.
   - PDF-ready outputs for governance and sharing.

4. **Statutory Outcomes**
   - Statutory assessments (EYFS, KS1, KS2, phonics, MTC) are calculated and reported using dedicated calculators.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which workflows are daily teacher tasks vs leadership reporting tasks?**
  - Teacher tasks: assessment entry, observation capture, class/pupil reports.
  - Leadership tasks: cohort/subject summaries, gap analysis, statutory outcomes.

- **Which workflows are statutory/regulated vs internal?**
  - Statutory: EYFS GLD, KS1/KS2 outcomes, phonics, MTC.
  - Internal: formative progress, target tracking, bespoke cohort summaries.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How do reporting outputs differ between UI and PDF?
  - UI is interactive and filter-driven; PDF is static, formatted for A4 output.

- Why are assessments segmented by term and academic year?
  - Progress requires comparison across specific points in time.

## Completion Check
You can describe how Sonar supports assessment collection, progress tracking, and statutory reporting, and you can point to the code areas that implement these workflows.
