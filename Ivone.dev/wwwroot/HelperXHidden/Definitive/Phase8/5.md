# Phase 8.5 — Compliance Practices And Data Retention

## What To Learn
Compliance requires clear data retention and deletion behavior, especially for pupil records and assessments.

## Why It Exists
Retention and deletion policies affect legal obligations and operational data integrity.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Pupil endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Pupil/*`
- Assessment endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Assessment/*`
- Observation endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Observation/*`

## Key Practices
- Avoid exposing unnecessary personal data in report endpoints.
- Ensure deletions are performed through controlled API routes rather than ad hoc scripts.

## Questions And Answers
- **How should retention policies be enforced?**
  - Through dedicated endpoints and controlled background jobs, with permissions and audit metadata preserved.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How does PDF export interact with retention policies?
  - PDFs are external artifacts; once exported they may exist outside the system’s retention controls.

## Completion Check
You can describe how retention and deletion should be approached in Sonar.
