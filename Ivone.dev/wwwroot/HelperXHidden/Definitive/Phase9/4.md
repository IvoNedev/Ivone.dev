# Phase 9.4 — Education Edge Cases In Tests

## What To Learn
Edge cases include missing assessments, out-of-band test scores, cohort shifts, and end-of-year projection terms.

## Why It Exists
These edge cases often reveal bugs in progress and attainment calculations.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Test data: `sonar-api/sonar-api-tests/data/*`
- Reports E2E: `sonar/automated-tests/e2e/Reports/*`

## Example Edge Cases
- No assessments in a term (effective assessments should fill).
- Assessments with out-of-band results (test scores).
- Reporting on End of Year Projection (TermId 99).
- Mixed year groups in a cohort.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which edge cases are not currently covered?**
  - Identify by reviewing test data and comparing to known domain behaviors (out-of-band, missing data, mixed cohorts).

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How should missing term data be represented in reports?
  - By using effective assessments where enabled, or by displaying empty results with clear labels.

## Completion Check
You can list the key education edge cases and explain how tests should cover them.
