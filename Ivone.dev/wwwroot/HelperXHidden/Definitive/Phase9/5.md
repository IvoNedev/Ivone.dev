# Phase 9.5 — Test Execution And Tooling

## What To Learn
Know how to run tests across the API and UI layers and how to interpret failures.

## Why It Exists
A change is not safe unless the relevant tests pass and failures are understood.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- API test projects: `sonar-api/sonar-api-tests-*`
- E2E tests: `sonar/automated-tests/e2e/Reports/*`

## Typical Commands
- API tests: `dotnet test` (run from `sonar-api` root or test project folders).
- UI tests: typically run via Playwright or test scripts in `sonar/automated-tests`.

## Questions And Answers
- **Where do you start when a report E2E test fails?**
  - Check report parameters, API response data, and report rendering in Reports Web.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Why do some failures only show up in PDF export?
  - PDF export captures static HTML and uses different CSS rules, exposing layout-specific bugs.

## Completion Check
You can run tests and interpret failures across API and report UI layers.
