# Phase 11.1 — Safely Adding New Education Features

## What To Learn
Adding a feature typically involves adding a feature key, adding API routes, and adding UI components. The change must preserve reporting integrity.

## Why It Exists
New features often touch assessments, reports, and permissions. Without careful integration, they introduce inconsistencies.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Feature keys: `sonar-api/sonar-utilities/src/FeatureKey.cs`
- API routes: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/*`
- Report UI: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/report/*`

## Safe Change Steps
1. Add or identify the feature key.
2. Implement API endpoints and handlers in the correct area.
3. Add report UI components and map them in routing.
4. Update permissions and feature access checks.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which components must be updated for a new report?**
  - API handler, report UI component, routing, and permissions/feature access.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How do you ensure a new report is available in PDF?
  - Confirm the report renders correctly in Reports Web and that PDF styling supports it.

## Completion Check
You can describe the steps required to add a new report or feature without breaking existing flows.
