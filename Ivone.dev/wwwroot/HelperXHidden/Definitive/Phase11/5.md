# Phase 11.5 — Rollout, Monitoring, And Post-Change Validation

## What To Learn
After changes, you must validate report outputs, monitor telemetry, and confirm no regressions in critical workflows.

## Why It Exists
Education reporting is sensitive; regressions may not be immediately visible without explicit checks.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Telemetry: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Infrastructure/Telemetry/*`
- Reports Web PDF pipeline: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/component/common/DownloadButton.tsx`
- E2E tests: `sonar/automated-tests/e2e/Reports/*`

## Post-Change Checklist
- Validate report outputs for key report types.
- Export PDFs and confirm layout correctness.
- Check telemetry for increased errors or slow queries.

## Questions And Answers
- **How do you verify that a change did not affect statutory outputs?**
  - Run relevant report endpoints, compare outputs against known good results, and check E2E tests if available.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- What signals indicate a regression in report performance?
  - Increased DB query latency, timeouts, or higher error rates in telemetry.

## Completion Check
You can describe how to validate and monitor changes after deployment.
