# Phase 11.4 — Reasoning About Impact Before Coding

## What To Learn
Any change should be evaluated across UI, API, data access, and reporting output. Impact analysis prevents unintended regressions.

## Why It Exists
Sonar is a multi-layer system; a small change can affect multiple reports and services.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- UI report components: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/report/*`
- API report handlers: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Reports/*`
- Data model: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/*`
- Queues: `sonar-api/sonar-queue/*`

## Impact Analysis Checklist
1. Does this change affect assessment data or its interpretation?
2. Which reports consume this data?
3. Do any queues or background jobs need to be re-run?
4. Does PDF output still render correctly?

## Questions And Answers
- **Which reports or screens depend on the data you plan to change?**
  - Identify usage by searching report handlers and report components that reference the entity or endpoint.

- **Which background jobs need to be re-run after schema or logic changes?**
  - Any job that recalculates report data or performs data preparation for the affected entities.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How can you validate impact in a safe environment?
  - Run integration tests, generate PDFs, and compare outputs across multiple report types.

## Completion Check
You can perform an impact analysis before making changes and identify the downstream effects.
