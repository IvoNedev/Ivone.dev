# Phase 6.1 — UI Architecture And Framework Choices

## What To Learn
Sonar uses React-based frontends: the main Sonar Web UI, the Reports Web UI, and a multi-school UI. Each is built as a separate frontend application.

## Why It Exists
The reporting UI is specialized and has different requirements (PDF export, large tables, charts) from the main UI.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Sonar Web: `sonar/sonar-web/src`
- Reports Web: `sonar/reports-web/src`
- Multi-school Web: `sonar-multischool/sonar-ms-web/src`

## Architectural Characteristics
- Component-based UI built around pages and reusable components.
- Report pages are typically mapped one-to-one with report types.
- Reports Web has dedicated PDF export logic.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which UI hosts the reporting screens?**
  - `sonar/reports-web` hosts report rendering and PDF export.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Why is Reports Web separate from Sonar Web?
  - Reports have specialized UI requirements and can be deployed independently.

## Completion Check
You can identify each frontend, its role, and where it lives in the repo.
