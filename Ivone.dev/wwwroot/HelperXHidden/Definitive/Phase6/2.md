# Phase 6.2 — State Management Approach

## What To Learn
Reports Web primarily uses React hooks for local state and a Redux store for form state. It also uses context providers for cross-cutting state like PDF export.

## Why It Exists
Report filters and parameters are stateful. Without consistent state management, report outputs become inconsistent.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Store configuration: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/store.ts`
- Hooks: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/hooks/*`
- Reports context: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/hooks/useReportsContext.tsx`

## Key Patterns
- **Local state** for report-specific selections (filters, display options).
- **Redux-form** for filter forms.
- **Context providers** for global report state (PDF pending status).

## Questions And Answers
- **Where are report parameters parsed and normalized?**
  - Reports Web helper functions under `sonar/reports-web/src/app/helpers/reportData/*`.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Why is Redux used primarily for forms?
  - Many report filters use `redux-form`, so a store is needed for consistent form behavior.

## Completion Check
You can identify how report state is managed and where to locate the key hooks and store setup.
