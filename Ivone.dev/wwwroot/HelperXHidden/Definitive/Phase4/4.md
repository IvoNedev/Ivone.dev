# Phase 4.4 — Shared Libraries And Utilities

## What To Learn
Shared libraries provide core domain constructs and shared logic that must be consistent across API and workers.

## Why It Exists
Duplication across services increases the risk of inconsistent reporting and business rules.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Utilities: `sonar-api/sonar-utilities/src/*`
- Shared core logic: `sonar-api/sonar-core/*`
- Data entities: `sonar-api/sonar-data/*`

## Key Shared Constructs
- **AssessmentPoint**: Defines the time dimension for all assessments.
- **FeatureKey**: Defines product features and assessment models.
- **Band** and **NationalCurriculumYear**: Encode educational year structures.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which shared library is authoritative for assessment point logic?**
  - `sonar-api/sonar-utilities/src/AssessmentPoint.cs`.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Why is `FeatureKey` in `sonar-utilities` and not UI?
  - It represents authoritative feature definitions used by multiple services.

## Completion Check
You can identify shared libraries and explain what each is responsible for.
