# Phase 10.1 — Environments (Dev, Test, Prod)

## What To Learn
Sonar has multiple environments with different configuration values and infrastructure definitions. These environments are managed via Helm charts and configuration files.

## Why It Exists
Each environment has different credentials, endpoints, and resource constraints.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- API Helm charts: `sonar-api/infrastructure/helm-*/*`
- Web Helm charts: `sonar/infrastructure/helm-*/*`
- Config files: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/appsettings.json`

## Questions And Answers
- **Which configs differ across AWS vs Azure?**
  - Helm values and hostnames differ by environment, including CORS and service endpoints.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Where are environment-specific URLs configured?
  - In Helm values files and in `appsettings.json` for local defaults.

## Completion Check
You can locate environment-specific configuration and explain how it differs across environments.
