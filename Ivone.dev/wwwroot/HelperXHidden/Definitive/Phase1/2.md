# Phase 1.2 — Assessments: Formative, Summative, Statutory, Test Scores

## What To Learn
Sonar supports multiple assessment types, each with distinct data models and reporting logic. You must understand their differences and where each is modeled in code.

## Why It Exists
Different assessment types serve different educational purposes and are reported differently. Mixing them up will lead to incorrect calculations and misleading reports.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Summative assessments: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/SummativeAssessmentEntity.cs`
- Formative objective assessments: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/FormativeObjectiveAssessmentEntity.cs`
- Statutory assessments: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/StatutoryAssessmentEntity.cs`
- Test paper assessments: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/TestPaperAssessmentEntity.cs`
- Assessment endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Assessment/*`
- Statutory endpoints and calculators: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Statutory/*`
- Test score orchestrator: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/TestScores/TestPaperAssessmentOrchestrator.cs`

## Summative Assessments
- Term-based judgments for pupil+subject.
- Typically mapped to a summative code (band/stage label).
- Used for progress tracking and attainment reporting.

## Formative Assessments
- Evidence-based assessment tied to objectives and strands.
- Captured as objective-level records to support triangulation and progress analysis.

## Statutory Assessments
- Required outcomes for specific phases and subjects.
- Calculated using dedicated headline calculators.

## Test Scores
- Numeric assessments that are mapped into ARE categories.
- Test scores can be out-of-band to reflect above/below expected performance.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which reports depend on formative data vs summative data?**
  - Formative data is used in reports that evaluate objective completion or triangulation. Summative data is used in progress and attainment reports.

- **Which assessment types are statutory and carry compliance obligations?**
  - Statutory assessments include EYFS GLD, KS1/KS2 outcomes, phonics, and MTC, calculated in `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Statutory/*`.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Why are test scores treated separately from summative judgments?
  - Test scores are numeric and require mapping into expectation categories, which differs from summative code sets.

- How does Sonar decide whether an assessment is in-band or out-of-band?
  - For test scores, the out-of-band band ID is compared to the pupil’s expected band, as seen in `TestPaperAssessmentOrchestrator.CategorizeAssessmentConsideringBands`.

## Completion Check
You can explain the differences between summative, formative, statutory, and test-score assessments, and you can identify where each is modeled and processed in the code.
