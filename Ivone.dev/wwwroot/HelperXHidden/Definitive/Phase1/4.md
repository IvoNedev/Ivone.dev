# Phase 1.4 — Reporting: Teacher vs Leadership Usage

## What To Learn
Reporting in Sonar is purpose-built for multiple audiences. Teachers need actionable class and pupil views; leadership needs cohort and performance trends. The reporting UI and API reflect these differences.

## Why It Exists
Reports drive decisions and accountability. A report that is great for a class teacher may be unusable for governors or leadership. Sonar provides multiple report shapes to support these needs.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Reports UI pages: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/report/*`
- Report components: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/component/*`
- Report routes and handlers: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Reports/*`
- PDF export: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/component/common/DownloadButton.tsx`

## Teacher-Facing Reports
- Emphasize individual pupils and small groups.
- Often display formative evidence and objectives.
- Require quick filtering by class, subject, and term.

## Leadership-Facing Reports
- Emphasize cohorts and trend analysis.
- Often aggregate across classes or year groups.
- Require consistent, printable outputs for governance.

## PDF-First Considerations
- Reports must fit A4 pages.
- Charts and tables must render predictably in PDF output.
- The PDF pipeline uses the rendered HTML, not a separate template, so UI layout choices matter.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which reports are classroom-facing vs leadership-facing?**
  - Classroom-facing: pupil overview, formative progress analysis, class summaries.
  - Leadership-facing: cohort performance, key stage outcomes, contextual summary.

- **Which reports are PDF-first?**
  - Any report that is routinely exported for governance or sharing. In code, PDF export is available for all report pages via `DownloadButton`.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How does Reports Web determine which report to render?
  - Reports Web uses routing and report parameter parsing in `sonar/reports-web/src/app/helpers/reportData/*` to map parameters to report components.

- How does the API decide which data to return for a report?
  - Each report handler in `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Reports/*` orchestrates its own data retrieval and transformation.

## Completion Check
You can differentiate teacher vs leadership reporting needs and identify where these differences are implemented in code.
