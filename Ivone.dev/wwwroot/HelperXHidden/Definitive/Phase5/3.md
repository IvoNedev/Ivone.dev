# Phase 5.3 — Mapping Education Concepts To Tables And Entities

## What To Learn
Education concepts (terms, year groups, summative codes, ARE categories) map directly to entities and schema structures.

## Why It Exists
Incorrect mapping leads to incorrect reporting outputs.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Summative assessments: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/SummativeAssessmentEntity.cs`
- ARE codes: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/AgeRelatedExpectationCodeEntity.cs`
- Summative codes: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/SummativeCodeEntity.cs`
- Formative objectives: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/FormativeObjectiveEntity.cs`

## Concept-to-Entity Mapping
- **Assessment Point** -> represented by `AssessmentPoint` value object and stored as academic year + term in assessment records.
- **Summative Judgement** -> `SummativeAssessmentEntity`.
- **Formative Evidence** -> `FormativeObjectiveAssessmentEntity`.
- **Statutory Outcome** -> `StatutoryAssessmentEntity`.
- **ARE Category** -> `AgeRelatedExpectationCodeEntity`.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which concept is stored in code vs derived on the fly?**
  - Assessment points and code sets are stored; progress and attainment comparisons are derived at runtime.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Where does the system determine expected band for a pupil?
  - Expected band is derived from the pupil’s year group and academic year offset in orchestration logic.

## Completion Check
You can map key education concepts to their corresponding entities.
