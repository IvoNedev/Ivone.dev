# Phase 3.3 — Services, Modules, and Bounded Contexts

## What To Learn
The API is organized into Areas that reflect domain modules. Understanding these boundaries helps you locate logic and avoid cross-cutting changes.

## Why It Exists
Bounded contexts isolate domain concepts and prevent accidental coupling.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- API areas: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/*`
- Legacy areas: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/AreasLegacy/*`

## Primary API Areas (Examples)
- **Assessment**: Summative and formative assessment endpoints.
- **Observation**: Observation creation, retrieval, and related media handling.
- **Reports**: Reporting endpoints and orchestrators.
- **Statutory**: Statutory outcome calculations and retrieval.
- **Target**: Target management and projection.
- **TestScores**: Test paper assessment logic.
- **MultiSchool**: Multi-school aggregation and reporting.
- **Wonde**: External data sync integration.

## How Contexts Interact
- Reports often call orchestration logic that depends on Assessment and Statutory modules.
- MultiSchool aggregates outputs from standard report logic.
- TestScores provides specialized paths used by reports and summaries.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which contexts are coupled through shared tables or stored procedures?**
  - Assessment and reporting contexts share summative assessment tables; statutory outcomes rely on shared pupil data; legacy areas may depend on stored procedures shared by multiple contexts.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How can you identify a domain boundary violation?
  - When one area directly manipulates entities or rules that belong to another area without using its public logic or orchestrators.

- How should you extend a context safely?
  - Add new handlers and data access within the same area, then expose them via routes.

## Completion Check
You can list the key API areas and describe how they relate to each other.
