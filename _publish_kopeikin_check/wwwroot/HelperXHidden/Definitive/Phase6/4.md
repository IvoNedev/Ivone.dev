# Phase 6.4 — Accessibility And Education-Specific UX Constraints

## What To Learn
Reports must be readable on-screen and printable as PDFs. This creates constraints on layout, color use, and chart sizing.

## Why It Exists
Teachers and leaders often share reports in print or PDF form. Layout issues can make reports unusable.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Print CSS: `sonar/reports-web/public/print.css`
- PDF CSS: `sonar/reports-web/public/DownloadPDFStyles.css`
- PDF pipeline: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/component/common/DownloadButton.tsx`

## Key Constraints
- A4 page layout and spacing.
- Avoiding overly wide tables or charts that are unreadable in PDF.
- Clear typography for staff and governance audiences.

## Questions And Answers
- **How does Sonar ensure PDF output is consistent?**
  - Reports Web captures HTML and injects `DownloadPDFStyles.css` before sending it to the API.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Why is layout stability critical for PDF?
  - PDF rendering does not execute interactive JS; layout must be correct at capture time.

## Completion Check
You can locate print/PDF styling and explain how the PDF pipeline applies it.
