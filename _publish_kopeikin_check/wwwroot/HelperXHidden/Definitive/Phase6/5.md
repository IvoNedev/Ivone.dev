# Phase 6.5 — Where Frontend Logic Must Stop

## What To Learn
Frontends should not re-implement business rules. They should only render and format data returned by the API.

## Why It Exists
If multiple clients apply different rules, reports become inconsistent and untrustworthy.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- UI helpers: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/helpers/*`
- API business logic: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/*`

## Examples Of Acceptable Frontend Logic
- Formatting values for display.
- Conditional UI rendering based on permissions.

## Examples Of Unacceptable Frontend Logic
- Recalculating ARE categories.
- Applying statutory conversion rules.
- Filtering data in a way that changes business meaning.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which computations should be removed from the UI?**
  - Any computation that affects correctness, especially assessment classification or statutory outcomes.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How do you decide whether a calculation is safe to keep in the UI?
  - If it changes the meaning of data rather than its presentation, it belongs in the API.

## Completion Check
You can clearly distinguish rendering logic from business rule logic.
