# Phase 6.3 — How Screens Map To Domain Concepts

## What To Learn
Reports and pages are mapped to domain concepts via routing and report registries. Each report component corresponds to a specific domain report type.

## Why It Exists
Correct mapping ensures that UI routes request the right data and that report outputs match their domain intent.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Report routing: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/router/index.tsx`
- Report enum: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/newreports/reports/pageEnums.ts`
- Legacy report registry: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/report/Index.tsx`

## Mapping Pattern
- A report ID in `SonarPage` maps to a route like `/reports/{id}`.
- The route selects a specific report component.
- The report component fetches data from the API and renders it.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which screens correspond to statutory reporting?**
  - Statutory reports map to dedicated report components and are routed using `SonarPage` enum values.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How do you add a new report screen?
  - Add a new enum entry, register a route, and create a report component.

## Completion Check
You can trace a report ID to its route and component, and you can explain how that maps to domain intent.
