# Phase 8.3 — Auditability And Traceability

## What To Learn
Auditability means being able to trace when and by whom data changed. In Sonar, some entities include creation metadata, but audit coverage is not uniform.

## Why It Exists
Reports and statutory outputs must be defensible, especially during disputes or inspections.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Assessment entities: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/*Assessment*`
- Observation entities: `sonar-api/sonar-data/Entity/ObservationEntity.cs`

## Audit Characteristics
- Many assessment entities include `CreatedDateTime` and `UserId` fields.
- Some legacy flows may not preserve full audit history.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which data is not fully auditable today?**
  - Legacy assessment flows and older stored procedure-based writes may not preserve full audit history beyond creation metadata.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How would you improve auditability for an entity?
  - Add explicit created/modified metadata and ensure updates preserve history if required.

## Completion Check
You can identify where audit metadata exists and explain the limitations of current audit coverage.
