# Phase 5.4 — Data Lifecycle (Creation → Mutation → Reporting)

## What To Learn
Data flows from assessment entry to storage to reporting and PDF export. Understanding this lifecycle is critical for changes that affect reporting.

## Why It Exists
Report correctness depends on the integrity of this data lifecycle.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Assessment endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Assessment/*`
- Observation endpoints: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Observation/*`
- Reports orchestration: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Reports/*`
- Reports Web rendering: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/report/*`

## Lifecycle Stages
1. **Creation**
   - Assessment or observation data is created via API endpoints.
2. **Mutation**
   - Corrections or updates occur via edit endpoints or import processes.
3. **Derivation**
   - Orchestrators compute ARE and progress outputs.
4. **Reporting**
   - Reports Web renders tables/charts using API data.
5. **Export**
   - PDF export captures report HTML and converts to PDF via API.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which workflows enqueue jobs to process data before reporting?**
  - Data preparation and integration pipelines use queues; core reporting uses synchronous retrieval.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Where is the PDF content generated?
  - Reports Web captures HTML and posts to the API’s `/reportpdf` endpoint.

## Completion Check
You can trace assessment data from entry to reporting and export.
