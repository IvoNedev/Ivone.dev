# Phase 9.1 — Unit, Integration, And End-to-End Testing

## What To Learn
Testing is split across API unit/integration tests and UI E2E tests for reports.

## Why It Exists
Different layers require different test strategies.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- API unit tests: `sonar-api/sonar-api-tests-unit`
- API integration tests: `sonar-api/sonar-api-tests-integration`
- Reports E2E tests: `sonar/automated-tests/e2e/Reports/*`

## Questions And Answers
- **Which reports have E2E coverage?**
  - Reports under `sonar/automated-tests/e2e/Reports` indicate which report flows are automated.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Why are E2E tests valuable for reports?
  - Reports are highly integrated: filters, API data, rendering, and PDF export.

## Completion Check
You can identify where tests live and which layers they cover.
