# Phase 9.3 — Gaps Or Risks In Current Coverage

## What To Learn
Legacy areas and stored procedure-heavy paths often lack modern automated tests.

## Why It Exists
These areas can regress without detection if tests are missing.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Legacy routes: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/AreasLegacy/*`
- Stored procedure wrappers: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/StoredProcedures/*`

## Typical Coverage Gaps
- Legacy endpoints without direct unit tests.
- Stored procedure behaviors that are not validated by integration tests.
- UI-only behaviors that are not asserted by E2E tests.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which bug reports point to missing tests?**
  - Review test gaps by examining historical changes and coverage; legacy areas are the most common sources of regressions.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How can you reduce risk in untested areas?
  - Add integration tests around the API and validate stored procedure outputs.

## Completion Check
You can identify high-risk areas with low test coverage and propose test additions.
