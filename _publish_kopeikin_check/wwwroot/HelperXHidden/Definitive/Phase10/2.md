# Phase 10.2 — CI/CD Pipeline

## What To Learn
Build and release are managed through pipeline YAML files and Helm deployments.

## Why It Exists
Reliable deployments depend on consistent build and release pipelines.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- API pipeline definitions: `sonar-api/build/*`
- Web pipeline definitions: `sonar/build/*`
- Repo pipeline entry: `sonar-api/bitbucket-pipelines.yml`

## Questions And Answers
- **Which projects are deployed together vs independently?**
  - API and workers are deployed independently via their respective release YAMLs. Frontends are deployed independently as separate builds.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How do pipeline changes impact deployments?
  - Changes in build YAMLs alter Docker build, Helm chart packaging, or release environments.

## Completion Check
You can locate pipeline definitions and explain which components they deploy.
