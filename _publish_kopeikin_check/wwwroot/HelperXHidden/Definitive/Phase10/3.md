# Phase 10.3 — Configuration And Secrets

## What To Learn
Configuration is primarily stored in JSON files and environment variables. Secrets are injected via environment-specific configuration.

## Why It Exists
Incorrect configuration breaks authentication, data access, and integrations.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- API config: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/appsettings.json`
- Dev container config: `sonar/.devcontainer/*`, `sonar-api/.devcontainer/*`
- Web config: `sonar/sonar-web/config/*`, `sonar/reports-web/*` (as applicable)

## Questions And Answers
- **Which secrets are pulled from secure storage vs env vars?**
  - Secrets are typically injected via environment variables or external secret stores; local development uses `.env` within devcontainers.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Where are machine keys configured for local development?
  - In `appsettings.json` and overridden via environment-specific config where needed.

## Completion Check
You can locate configuration files and explain how secrets are injected per environment.
