# Phase 10.5 — Failure Modes And Recovery

## What To Learn
The most common failure modes involve queues, database connectivity, and PDF generation.

## Why It Exists
Understanding failure modes helps you troubleshoot quickly and design resilient changes.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- Queue processor: `sonar-api/sonar-queue-processor/src/Program.cs`
- Queue runner: `sonar-api/sonar-queue-runner/src/Program.cs`
- Document generation: `sonar-api/sonar-document-generation/src`

## Common Failure Modes
- **Queue backlog**: processing slower than enqueue rate.
- **Database downtime**: API cannot read/write assessments.
- **PDF generation failures**: HTML to PDF conversion errors.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which services can fail independently without full outage?**
  - Queue processors and document generation can fail without taking down the API, but they degrade report pipelines and exports.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How do you detect a queue backlog?
  - Monitoring queue depth in RabbitMQ and checking processor logs.

## Completion Check
You can list the common failure modes and their symptoms, and you know where to investigate.
