# Phase 4.3 — Naming Conventions And Patterns

## What To Learn
Naming conventions are used consistently across API areas, report components, and entities. Recognizing these patterns makes navigation predictable.

## Why It Exists
Consistent naming reduces cognitive load and prevents misalignment between UI and API.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- API routes and handlers: `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/*`
- Report registry: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/report/Index.tsx`
- Report IDs and enums: `sonar/reports-web/src/app/newreports/reports/pageEnums.ts`

## API Naming Patterns
- **Areas** map to route groups, e.g., `Areas/Assessment`, `Areas/Reports`, `Areas/Statutory`.
- **Handlers** usually match the route or report name, e.g., `SummativeDataCompletionHandler`.
- **Orchestrators** encapsulate multi-step transformations, e.g., `AreAssessmentOrchestrator`.

## UI Naming Patterns
- Report components mirror report names (e.g., `AgeRelatedOverview.tsx`).
- The report registry exports a dictionary of report components.

## Questions And Answers
- **How do report IDs map to pages and parameters?**
  - Report IDs are mapped through enums and used to select specific report components in the Reports Web routing layer.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How do you locate a report handler from a report page?
  - Start with the report component in `sonar/reports-web/src/app/report/*`, then search for the API endpoint it calls under `sonar-api/sonar-api/src/Areas/Reports/*`.

## Completion Check
You can explain how names map across API handlers, UI components, and report IDs.
