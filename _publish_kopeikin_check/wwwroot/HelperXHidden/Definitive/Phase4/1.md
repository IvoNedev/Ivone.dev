# Phase 4.1 — Repository Layout (All Repos In Scope)

## What To Learn
Sonar is a multi-repo system. Each repo has a distinct role in the overall product.

## Why It Exists
You must edit the correct codebase for the feature you are working on.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- `sonar-api` (backend and workers)
- `sonar` (main web UI and reports UI)
- `sonar-multischool` (multi-school UI)

## Repo Responsibilities
- **sonar-api**
  - API and business logic, data access, migrations, queues, and workers.
- **sonar**
  - Sonar Web UI and Reports Web UI.
- **sonar-multischool**
  - Multi-school dashboards and workflows.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which repo hosts each user-facing UI?**
  - `sonar/sonar-web` is the main UI; `sonar/reports-web` is the reporting UI; `sonar-multischool/sonar-ms-web` is the multi-school UI.

- **Which repo hosts PDF and reporting UI?**
  - `sonar/reports-web`.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- Which repo contains database migrations?
  - `sonar-api/sonar-dbup`.

- Which repo contains the queue processor?
  - `sonar-api/sonar-queue-processor`.

## Completion Check
