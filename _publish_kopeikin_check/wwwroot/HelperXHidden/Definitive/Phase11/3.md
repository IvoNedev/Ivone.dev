# Phase 11.3 — Common Mistakes New Developers Make

## What To Learn
Typical mistakes involve duplicating logic, ignoring phase-specific rules, and changing schemas without migrations.

## Why It Exists
These mistakes lead to inconsistent reporting and unstable deployments.

## Where It Lives In The Codebase
- UI helpers (risk of duplicated logic): `sonar/reports-web/src/app/helpers/*`
- Shared utilities (phase-specific rules): `sonar-api/sonar-utilities/src/*`
- Migrations: `sonar-api/sonar-dbup/src/Scripts/*`

## Common Mistakes
- Reimplementing ARE logic in UI instead of using API output.
- Modifying legacy routes without understanding stored procedure dependencies.
- Changing a feature key without updating dependent reports.
- Adding schema changes without DbUp migrations.

## Questions And Answers
- **Which mistakes have already caused production incidents?**
  - Typically those involving legacy areas, stored procedure dependencies, and report logic duplication.

## Additional Questions You Should Be Able To Answer
- How can you prevent regression when touching report logic?
  - Add tests and validate both UI output and API data.

## Completion Check
You can list common mistakes and explain how to avoid them.
